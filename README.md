# How to Use This Script File.md

Note: `atog` is an abbreviation for **a**u**to**matic **g**it

**FIRST:**

Run `setup.sh` file. It should copy all the necessary files required (there isn't a lot of files though)

To run the script, open up terminal and input the following command =>  `~/./atog.sh`

Make sure to run this command on a git directory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The script will contain the following git commands:

- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Another commit made to the project. Inspect more for details."`
- `git push`
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point, it may prompt you to enter your log-in details (depending on whether the directory is public/private). Enter those in, and it should work.
