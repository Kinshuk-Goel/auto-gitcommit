# How to Use This Script File.md

Note: `atog` is an abbreviation for **a**u**to**matic **g**it

**FIRST:** run `bash`

Note: **You must be using bash. Fish and zsh may not work well**

Run `setup.sh` file.

To run the script, open up terminal and input the following command =>  `~/./atog.sh`

This will run the script from the **Home** directory, not any other random directory!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The script will contain the following git files:

- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Another commit made to the project. Inspect more for details."`
- `git push`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point, it will prompt you to enter your log-in details. Enter those in, and it's successful!
