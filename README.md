# How to Use This Script File.md

Note: `atog` is an abbreviation for **a**u**to**matic **g**it

**FIRST-IMPORTANT:**
Check to see if you have git installed on your terminal with `git --version`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FIRST:** run `bash`

Note: **You must be using bash. Fish and zsh may not work well** (you could give it a try though, why not?)

Run `setup.sh` file. It should copy all the necessary files required (there isn't a lot of files though)

If terminal results back with *Success!*, then you're ready to go!
To run the script, open up terminal and input the following command =>  `~/./atog.sh`

Make sure to run `atog` command on a git directory. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pro tip: See what happens when you type in terminal just `~/./a` and hit `TAB` (Hint: You'll find it more efficient then just typing the command-line over and over again!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The script will contain the following git files:

- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Another commit made to the project. Inspect more for details."`
- `git push`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point, it may prompt you to enter your log-in details (depending on whether the directory is public/private). Enter those in, and it's successful! 

Feel free to checkout the script and files being used, and if you find any improvements please create a pull request so I could improve this. 

**Thanks :D**
