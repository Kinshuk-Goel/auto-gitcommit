# How to Use This Script File.md

Note: `atog` is an abbreviation for **a**u**to**matic **g**it

Copy/Move the `atog.sh` file into your Home directory. 

I could not make a script that would do that, because I would continuously get an error on the home directory: to specifiy the user, like /home/Sam

To run the script, open up terminal and input the following command =>  `./atog.sh`

The script will contain the following git files:

- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Another commit made to the project. Inspect more for details."`
- `git push`


At this point, it will prompt you to enter your log-in details. Enter those in, and it's successful! 

Feel free to checkout all the files with a text editor so you can believe that I'm not lying, and if you find any improvements please create a pull request so I could improve this. Thanks :D
